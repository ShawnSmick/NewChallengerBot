# NewChallengerBot
New challenger bot is a simple discord bot for creating vs matches between players and displaying a fancy image for the match! Each player can have a custom log set for themselves that will display in the match image.

New Challenger also records Wins and Losses for those matches and allow the user to look at their current stats!

# Future

My intention for this to slowly add more features such as an Elo system of some type as well as a distinction between different games, and maybe some tools for randomly selecting maps.
